# lithium_and_temperature

This repostory contain the run scripts for the paper "A simulation study of the impact of fracture networks on the co-production of geothermal energy and lithium". The implementation is by Shin Irgens Banshoya, PhD at Dept. of Mathematics, UiB.

The implementation uses the branch 'modified_discretization_matrices' in PorePy. The easiest way to install this branch is to follow the PorePy installation instructions, but replace the line `git checkout main` to `git checkout modified_discretization_matrices`. If you encounter a problem with the installation, please create an issue at PorePy's GitHub page

The simulations will take some time to run and do require some comutational memory. Running the simulations on your own machine is at your own risk.
